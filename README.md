Ruan, G.F. Webb, Journal of Theoretical Biology 249 (2007)](http://www.math.u-bordeaux1.fr/~pmagal100p/Nosocomial%20infection/nosocomial.htm)

Instructions
============

In order to run the DEM model, please copy all the files into a directory called for example "C:\DEM-model\". Then by using MATLAB, you run the program "SimulationDEM.m". Note that in SimulationDEM.m you can modify all the parameters of the DEM.
